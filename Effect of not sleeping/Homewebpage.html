    <p>If you’ve ever spent a night tossing and turning, you already know how you’ll feel the next day — tired, cranky, and out of sorts. But missing out on the recommended 7 to 9 hours of shut-eye nightly does more than make you feel groggy and grumpy.

    The long-term effects of sleep deprivation are real.

    It drains your mental abilities and puts your physical health at real risk. Science has linked poor slumber with all kinds of health problems, from weight gain to a weakened immune syste
    If you eat well and exercise regularly but don’t get at least seven hours of sleep every night, you may undermine all your other efforts.

    Sleep disorders expert Harneet Walia, MD, says it’s important to focus on getting enough sleep, something many of us lack. “First and foremost, we need to make sleep a priority,” she says. “We always recommend a good diet and exercise to everyone. Along the same lines, we need to focus on sleep as well.”</p>

    <div id="Causes" class="causes">
        <h1>Causes of sleep deprivation:</h1>
    </div>


<div class="par">
    <p>In a nutshell, sleep deprivation is caused by consistent lack of sleep or reduced quality of sleep. Getting less than 7 hours of sleep on a regular basis can eventually lead to health consequences that affect your entire body. This may also be caused by an underlying sleep disorder.

    <h1>How Lack of Sleep Affects Eyesight?</h1>
</div>




<div class="par">
    <p>Sleep deprivation can take a hefty toll on your eyes. Some side effects are mild, while others can become quite serious.

    One of the less dangerous side effects of sleep deprivation is having dark circles underneath your eyes. When you don’t get the sleep you need, you may notice that your eyes look puffy or that you have dark circles underneath your eyes. This makes you look tired and older.

    Skimping on sleep can also lead to eye spasms and twitching throughout the day. This can become incredibly frustrating and make it difficult for you to read, do your work, or drive safely.

    A slightly more serious negative side effect of lack of sleep is having dry, itchy, bloodshot eyes. Dry eyes can be painful and cause irritation, but this can also mean your eyes aren’t getting the lubrication they need to stay healthy. You may also notice that you are sensitive to light or that your vision is blurred. The other problem with having dry, itchy eyes is that you are more likely to rub them, which could cause eye infections. Being sleep deprived also weakens your immune system, so you are more vulnerable to infections when you don’t get enough rest.</p>

    <h1>What happens when you don’t get enough sleep?</h1>
</div>




<div class="par">
    <p>Your doctor urges you to get enough sleep for good reason, Dr. Walia says.  Shorting yourself on shut-eye has a negative impact on your health in many ways:

    Short-term problems can include:

Lack of alertness: Even missing as little as 1.5 hours can have an impact, research shows.
Impaired memory: Lack of sleep can affect your ability to think and to remember and process information.
Relationship stress: It can make you feel moody, and you can become more likely to have conflicts with others.
Quality of life: You may become less likely to participate in normal daily activities or to exercise.
Greater likelihood for car accidents: Drowsy driving accounts for thousands of crashes, injuries and fatalities each year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
If you continue to operate without enough sleep, you may see more long-term and serious health problems. Some of the most serious potential problems associated with chronic sleep deprivation are high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure or stroke. Other potential problems include obesity, depression and lower sex drive.

Chronic sleep deprivation can even affect your appearance.  Over time, it can lead to premature wrinkling and dark circles under the eyes. Also, research links a lack of sleep to an increase of the stress hormone cortisol in the body. Cortisol can break down collagen, the protein that keeps skin smooth.</p>

    <h1>How much sleep do you actually need?</h1>
</div>




<div class="par">
    <p>Everyone feels better after a good night’s rest.  But now, thanks to a report from the National Sleep Foundation, you can aim for a targeted sleep number tailored to your age.

The foundation based its report on two years of research. Published in a recent issue of the foundation’s journal Sleep Health, the report updates previous sleep recommendations. It breaks them into nine age-specific categories with a range for each, which allows for individual differences:<br>

Older adults, 65+ years: 7-8 hours<br>
Adults, 26-64 years: 7-9 hours<br>
Young adults, 18-25 years: 7-9 hours<br>
Teenagers, 14-17 years: 8-10 hours<br>
School-age children, 6-13 years: 9-11 hours<br>
Preschool children, 3-5 years: 10-13 hours<br>
Toddlers, 1-2 years: 11-14 hours<br>
Infants, 4-11 months: 12-15 hours<br>
Newborns, 0-3 months: 14-17 hours<br>

Dr. Walia says there’s evidence that genetic, behavioral and environmental factors help determine how much sleep an individual needs for the best health and daily performance.

But a minimum of seven hours of sleep is a step in the right direction to improve your health, she says.</p>

    <p><strong>Make time for downtime : </strong><br>

“In our society, nowadays, people aren’t getting enough sleep. They put sleep so far down on their priority list because there are so many other things to do – family, personal and work life,” Dr. Walia says. “These are challenges, but if people understand how important adequate sleep is, it makes a huge difference.”<br>

<strong>Additional Sleep Tips : </strong><br>
Keep a regular sleep-wake cycle. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.<br>
Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine in the four to six hours before bedtime.<br>
Don't exercise within two hours of bedtime. Exercising five or six hours before bedtime may help you sleep more soundly.<br>
Don't eat large meals within two hours of bedtime.<br>
Don't nap later than 3 p.m.<br>
Sleep in a dark, quiet room with a comfortable temperature.<br>
If you can't fall asleep within 20 minutes, do a quiet activity somewhere else and return to bed when you're sleepy.<br>
Wind down in the 30 minutes before bedtime with a relaxing pre sleep ritual such as a warm bath, soft music, or reading.<br>
If consistently applying these tips doesn't work, see your health care professional and discuss your sleep problems. It is important to make sure that your sleep problems are not caused by a serious physical illness. You should also review the medications you are taking to make sure that they are not causing your sleep problems. Last, but not least, there are medications that can help you sleep that are safe when prescribed by a physician and taken as directed.</p>
